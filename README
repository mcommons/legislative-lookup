=== Description
 
Rails application and database to lookup congressional and state legislative districts by latitude and longitude.

=== Installation

Install Postgres and postGIS, set up a database, and populate it.

On Ubuntu 11.04:
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib postgresql postgresql-8.4-postgis libpq-dev # libpq-dev needed for gem
# Postgres won't let you connect without a password out of the box. Create a new postgres user with a password or configure postgres to trust all connections from localhost and make sure the "postgres" user in postgres doesn't have a password. These instruction assume the later. You can do that by editing /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf and adding a line ABOVE THE DEFAULT RULES like this:
# host    all         postgres    127.0.0.1/32          trust
DB="congress_development" # or whatever you want to call it
sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF8 $DB
createlang -h localhost -U postgres plpgsql $DB
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d $DB -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d $DB -f /usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d $DB -c "select postgis_lib_version();" # to make sure postgis works
gem install postgres -v '0.7.9.2008.01.28' # this is what's used in production
./script/server
# Visit http://localhost:3000/. The page should load although nothing will work yet because there's no data in the database.
rake db:migrate
# If ruby is installed system-wide (ie not with rvm) and PATH isn't set up properly, you might need to run it with something like:
# PATH=/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/:$PATH rake db:migrate
